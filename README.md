### "Generic Dungeon Game"/Final Fantasy 1 clone
A simple dungeon crawler/RPG adventure game made in LibGDX Java.

Originally just a generic dungeon game, but after playing some classic FF1 I've decided to make it more like an FF1 clone as you can tell by the graphics so far.

This is basically my first attempt at making a decent game, so I am using a few tutorials etc. 
Feel free to contribute however you like, especially cleaning up the vast array of spaghetti code and probably bad use of 
LibGDX.

This is in the form of a gradle project, for more information of how to incoporate a LibGDX project
