### "Generic Dungeon Game"
A simple dungeon crawler made in LibGDX Java.

I borrowed the graphics from 'Legends of Yore' and also a few other ideas.

This is basically my first attempt at making a decent game, so I am using a few tutorials etc. 
Feel free to contribute however you like, especially cleaning up the vast array of spaghetti code and probably bad use of 
LibGDX.

This is in the form of a gradle project, for more information of how to incoporate a LibGDX project
