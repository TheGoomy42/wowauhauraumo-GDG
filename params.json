Go to the /build/ folder for all of them.\r\n\r\n#### Current Tasks\r\n* **v0.4.0**\r\n  * Continue to document existing code\r\n  * Add a dungeon\r\n  * Add the ability to encounter and fight enemies in this dungeon\r\n    * Add FF1-style battle mechanism\r\n    * Add multiple floors using two-way and one-way portals\r\n  * Import more tiles into the tilesets to use\r\n  * Import enemy sprites\r\n  * Add encounters in the overworld\r\n\r\n#### Version History\r\n(based off of some variation of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/))\r\n* **v0.4.0 [CURRENT] [WIP]**\r\n  * Nothing yet! see above for planned additions.\r\n* **v0.3.0** \r\n  * Added some documentation to guide those who want to contribute. [WIP]\r\n  * The player now walks slightly slower in the overworld.\r\n  * Added logging using [EsotericSoftware's Minlog](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/minlog)\r\n  * Portals are now the universal teleporting mechanism. No spawns, exits or whatever. They also work, which is a plus.\r\n    * Portals become 'inactive' you tp to them, until you stop colliding with it.\r\n* **v0.2.0** \r\n  * Added maps (currently just 2) and portals to travel between them.\r\n* **v0.1.0** \r\n  * Initial release. Includes movement and collision on a single map.\r\n","google":"UA-66549891-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
